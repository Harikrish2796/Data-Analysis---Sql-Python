Sales Data Analysis Project

Project Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to analyzing sales data to uncover valuable business insights. It showcases my skills in data extraction, transformation, loading (ETL), and analysis using Python and SQL.

- Extraction: Utilized Python and Pandas to read and preprocess sales data from a Kaggle dataset.
- Transformation: Applied data cleaning and transformation techniques to prepare the data for analysis.
- Loading: Loaded the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient querying.
- Data Analysis: Conducted analysis using SQL to derive insights into sales performance.


## Data Source

The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle. It includes detailed records of sales transactions.


## Project Workflow

1. Data Extraction and Transformation

- Extraction: Downloaded and extracted the sales data from a compressed `.zip` file.
- Transformation:
  - Cleaned and standardized column names.
  - Calculated new metrics such as `discount_price`, `sale_price`, and `profit`.
  - Converted date columns to a standardized format.
  - Removed unnecessary columns to optimize the dataset.

2. Data Loading into MySQL

- Setup: Defined the database schema to ensure proper data types and relationships.
- Loading: Imported the cleaned data into the MySQL database for analysis.

3. Data Analysis with SQL

  - Identify top revenue-generating products.
  - Analyze regional sales performance.
  - Compare sales growth across different years.
  - Determine peak sales periods for various product categories.
  - Identify the fastest-growing sub-categories by profit.

  Insights

- Top Products: The analysis identified the top 10 products that generated the highest revenue.
- Regional Performance: Each region's top-selling products were identified, highlighting regional preferences.
- Sales Trends: Sales growth was analyzed month-over-month, comparing 2022 and 2023.
- Category Performance: The best-performing months for each product category were determined.
- Profit Growth: The sub-category with the highest profit growth in 2023 compared to 2022 was highlighted.
